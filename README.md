# Delen Boilerplate 
We have provided this git repository that contains a boilerplate to kick start your new project with Delen Components. Our JS components are build with Angular and so is this boilerplate. If you prefer to use another JS framework you still have the possibility to use our css which can be found in the `styles` folder.

## Delen Private Bank - Components
### UI Components Team
At Delen Private Bank we have a dedicated team who work on custom components. They develop the building blocks of our UI for the website and for the mobile app. Our JS components are currently at Angular v5.

### Why you might want to use our components?
Your app will be consistent with our branding. UI & UX provided.
You don't have to develop something from scratch and can save valuable time.

> There is no obligation to use our components but we wanted to give you the possibility to use them.
## Getting Started

Additionally we provide our components that can be found in the packages folder.

### Requirements

yarn install
```
