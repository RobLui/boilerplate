# Delen Boilerplate 
We have provided this git repository that contains a boilerplate to kick start your new project with Delen Components.

## Delen Private Bank - Components
### UI Components Team
At Delen Private Bank we have a dedicated team who work on custom components. They develop the building blocks of our UI for the website and for the mobile app.

### Why you might want to use our components?
Your app will be consistent with our branding. UI & UX provided.
You don't have to develop something from scratch and can save valuable time.

> There is no obligation to use our components but we wanted to give you the possibility to use them.
## Getting Started
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.4.
Additionally we provide our components that can be found in the packages folder.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Tips from our ex-hackathon participants
* Use source control GIT (https://education.github.com/pack).
* [Trello](https://trello.com/) can be a helpful tool for task management and assignment in your team.

## Support
If you are in need of some support you can ask questions in person or on slack. We would like to ask you to post this in public channels so others can view this as well so we can avoid answering the same questions.
